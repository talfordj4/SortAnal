Analysis of Sorting Algorithm

Hypothesis:
The average-case time complexity of the sorting algorithm is O(n^2). This is based on the patterns observed in the data.

- Random Arrays: As the size of the arrays increases, the number of key comparisons increases significantly, suggesting a quadratic relationship.
- Ascending Arrays: The number of comparisons is consistently minimal, specifically n - 1. This shows the algorithm performs well on sorted data.
- Descending Arrays: The number of comparisons is similar to that of random arrays, indicating poor performance when data is reverse-sorted.

Estimation for Array Size 25,000:
To estimate how many comparisons the algorithm will make for an array of size 25,000, we can use the data we have for size 20,000, which is about 100,000,000 comparisons.
We can use this formula to make our estimate:
Estimated Comparisons for 25,000 = (25,000 / 20,000)² × 100,000,000
= 156,250,000

Conclusion:
The analysis supports the hypothesis that the algorithm has O(n^2) behavior, especially with random or descending arrays, while it performs efficiently with sorted arrays.
